BASE Jumping Canopy

These files are for a BASE jumping canopy, originally designed by Chris Loidolt and Nick Burden.

We do not guarantee the accuracy of the DXF files for direct use on an automatic cutter (laser, cnc or otherwise.) Every cutter is slightly different and you might have to make adjustments in order for the files to meet your needs.

If you notice any problems with the files please submit them as issues.
